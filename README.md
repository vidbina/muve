# Muve

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/muve.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/muve)

The Muve gem is designed to allow for the quick implementation of the 
Muvement API logic into a project. At the very moment this is very 
experimental and subject to massive changes which is why I wouldn't recommend
others to use this gem as yet :wink:.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'muve'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install muve
